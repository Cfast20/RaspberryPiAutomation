In this project, Servo motors will be used to make the RC move. Using the AB Electronics UK Servo Pi Python Library, we can
map out functions to control the speed at which the servo motor is turning. Servo motors use pulse width modulation (PWM). 

Don't know what that is, here is a good explanation.

This section will show specified functions for the RC to make the servo motors move.
